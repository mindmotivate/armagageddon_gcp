# The Sith Terraform Challenge

## Introduction
In the shadows of the galaxy, a new challenge has been issued by the ominous Sith Lord Lagus. Only the most skilled acolytes of infrastructure as code will survive his rigorous test. This repository holds the key to salvation and power.

## The Challenge
Acolytes must harness the dark side of the Force to conjure up a Terraform script that can create a VPC, spawn a VM within it, and serve a homepage to the galaxy. The VM must be accessible via a public link, and the script must be pushed to this very GitHub repository.

## Tasks
1. **Terraform Script with a VPC**: Create a virtual private cloud to isolate your dark creation.
2. **VM within your VPC**: Summon a virtual machine that will host your homepage.
3. **Homepage on the VM**: The face of your project, make it represent the power of the dark side.
4. **Publicly Accessible Link**: Your creation should be visible to all, friend and foe alike.
5. **Git Push to GitHub**: Prove your worth by pushing your scripts to the repository.
6. **Output File**: Your script must output the following:
   - **Public IP**: The gateway to your power.
   - **VPC ID**: The domain of your creation.
   - **Subnet of the VM**: The secluded corner of your empire.
   - **Internal IP of the VM**: The heart of your operation.

## The Ominous Overlord
Lord Malgus watches over the process from his throne of code. Fail, and you will be banished from the realm of infrastructure for all eternity.
